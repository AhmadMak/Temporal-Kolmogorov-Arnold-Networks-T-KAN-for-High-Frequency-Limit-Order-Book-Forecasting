# Experiment Data
The FI-2010 dataset is too large for GitHub hosting (approx. 800MB). 
To run the T-KAN training or backtests:
1. Download the dataset from the official source, I used the training and test sets 7 for my experiments
2. Place the `.bin` files directly into this directory.
3. Ensure the folder name remains `Experiment-Datasets`.
